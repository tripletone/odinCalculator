1. Create functions for the basic math operators, add, subtract, multiply and divide.

3. Create a new function named operate that has 3 paramaters, an operator and 2 numbers which then calls upon one of the above functions on the numbers. 
> if statements to check operators

4. Create basic HTML calculator for each digit and operator including =
>Should be a display for calculator
